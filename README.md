## 🧱 HTML Structure Guidelines

### ✅ You Can Modify: `preview.html`

```html
<div class="post-container">
  <!-- ✅ Customize your design layout here -->
</div>
```

### ❌ Do NOT Modify:

```html
<div class="frame-wrapper">
  <!-- ❌ Keep the outer frame and resolution unchanged -->
</div>
```

### Add/Copy New Posts in `index.html`:

```html
<div class="post-container">
  <!-- ✅ Reusable component for other designs -->
</div>
```

## 📐 Design Dimensions

* **Post Size:** `1024px x 1024px` (standard square format for Instagram/Facebook)
* This simulates a real-world social post space—stay within this canvas.
* Use `px`, `rem`, or `%` for all spacing, padding, and layout.

---

## 🎨 CSS Styling Guidelines

Design your social post with **modern, mobile-first styles** and **responsive layout principles**.

### 🎯 Goals per Section:

#### ✅ Background & Layout

* Use gradients, patterns, images, or solid colors.
* Maintain visual harmony and content alignment.
* Use `position`, `z-index`, and layering where needed.

#### ✅ Typography

* Strong title text, supporting subtitles, and clean paragraph formatting.
* Use Google Fonts or custom web fonts.
* Good spacing and alignment improve post legibility.

#### ✅ Visual Elements

* Use call-to-action buttons, badges, or stickers (optional).
* Add brand logo or watermark if applicable.
* Icons or emojis are encouraged for engagement.
